# reccr
(Decentralised Brex , Xero, Quickbooks)

==========
Problem:
===========

Managing the payroll expenses on a centralized system is always risky. 
1. Single point of control.
2. Single point of failure. 
2. Settling/reconciling the accounts very difficult. 
3. Auditing process is very time-consuming. 
4. Lots of manual work involved in HR, Manager, Accountant part. 

Solution
===========
A humble attempt to build a decentralized unified platform where one can manage the database of the employee as well as automate their payment. At devRecurr/Akunledger you can

1. Enter the details about your employees.
2. Assign the role and manager.
3. Put the payment.
4. Automate the payment on an hourly/weekly/daily/monthly basis. 
5. Many more..

Project details
===========

1. ConntractCode: Here Recurr.scilla code is written. You can take the code and run on zil online ide. This contract can easily take the entry of a company first, then enter the details about your employee like name, address, manager. Later you can do an update on the employee profile also. You can mention what rate a particular employee got to hire. 

2. Front-end code: This part is taken from the hello world example. This part is half done. Need to work more on it. (After hack it can be made full fledge). 


Next steps
======

This hackathon gave a good amount of exposure to learning scilla and architecture of Zilliqa. Since time duration was short and learning was a lot. There is some functionality that will be finished in the next stage like automating the payment with XSGD. The current version is a decentralized version of Xero/QuickBooks (payroll), after including the recurring payment feature it would be a decentralized version of Brex.
